---

#### üèóÔ∏è Test Design Structure

Unlike traditional LMS tests that are **Test ‚Üí Questions ‚Üí Answers**,  
this platform uses a **section-based hierarchy** for better organization:

**Test ‚Üí Sections ‚Üí Questions ‚Üí Answers**

- **Test**  
  - Core metadata (title, description, type: quiz, placement, evaluation)  
  - Scoring configuration (fixed, per-question, per-section, or custom logic)

  - Logical grouping of questions (e.g., **Reading, Writing, Speaking**)  
  - Can have **individual time limits** and **section scoring rules**  
  - **Optional instruction text or media** per section  

- **Questions**  
  - Linked to a section  
  - Supports **multimedia prompts** (Text, Audio, Video, Image)  

- **Answers (Student Responses)**  
  - Supports **Text, Audio Recording, Video Recording, Image Upload**  
  - Can allow **different input types** per question for interactive assessments  

---

#### üéØ Frontend Display Logic

- **Single-section tests**  
  - **Frontend may hide the section header** for simplicity  
  - **Questions can appear directly** for a streamlined quiz experience  
  - **Optional setting per test**: `showSectionHeader` = true/false  

- **Multi-section tests**  
  - Display sections clearly with **instructions and progress**  
  - **Section navigation** (next/prev or auto-advance)  
  - **Optional per-section timer**  

---

#### ‚úÖ Supported Question & Answer Types

**Question Types (Prompt to Student):**  
- **Text** ‚Üí Written instructions or problem statements

- **Audio Recording** ‚Üí Speaking or verbal explanation  
- **Video Recording** ‚Üí Presentations, role-plays, or skill demonstrations  
- **Image Upload** ‚Üí Handwritten solutions, photo-based tasks  

**Example Interactive Scenarios:**  
1. **Text Question + Audio Answer** ‚Üí Oral exams or speaking tests  
2. **Audio Question + Text Answer** ‚Üí Listening comprehension

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ SaaS Business Model & Monetization

The LMS operates as a **multi-tenant SaaS platform** with a **dual monetization strategy**:  
1. **Subscription-Based Pricing** (predictable revenue)  
2. **Usage-Based Commission** (performance-aligned revenue)

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Subscription-Based Pricing (Baseline Revenue)

- **Tiered subscription plans** remain the core model for predictable MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue).  
- Tiers can be defined by:
  - **Number of active students or staff users**  
  - **Storage allocation** for video, PDFs, and test data  
  - **Feature access** (advanced analytics, integrations, white-labeling)  

**Example Tiers:**

| Tier          | Monthly Price | Key Features                                        |
|---------------|--------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Free/Trial**| $0           | Limited courses, 1 branch, branding by SaaS         |
| **Basic**     | $49          | X active students, email notifications, basic reports |
| **Pro**       | $199         | Advanced analytics, WhatsApp/Telegram, moderate storage |
| **Enterprise**| Custom       | Unlimited students, white-label, custom domain, priority support |

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Usage-Based Commission (Growth Revenue)

Beyond the subscription, the platform earns **commission per enrollment** or **per user activity**.  

**Commission Models:**

1. **Percentage per Enrollment**  
   - e.g., 5-10% of the course/program fee charged to end-users.  
   - Ideal if tenants sell courses to the public.  

2. **Fixed Fee per Enrollment**  
   - e.g., $1-$2 per new student enrollment.  
   - Works well for internal corporate training where prices are fixed.  

3. **Hybrid**  
   - A **small subscription fee + per-user commission**, ensuring revenue from both low and high-volume tenants.

**Advantages:**  
- **Aligns revenue with tenant success**: When tenants grow, the SaaS earns more.  
- **Lowers barrier to entry**: Tenants can start with a lower subscription but share revenue as they scale.  
- **Supports freemium-to-paid conversion**: Small tenants can start free and pay via commissions.  

---

### üí° Recommended Implementation Flow

1. **Track Enrollments & Active Users** per tenant in real-time.  
2. **Generate Automated Usage Reports** for commission calculation.  
3. **Integrate with Billing System**:
   - Subscription invoice + commission fees on the same monthly bill.  
4. **Offer Optional Cap**:
   - Limit commission per month for high-volume enterprise clients.  

---

### üè∑Ô∏è Enterprise & White-Label Upsell

- White-labeling and enterprise support remain **premium features** under **subscription plans**.  
- Combining subscription + commission ensures **high LTV (Lifetime Value)** from large tenants.  

---

### üìä Example Revenue Flow

- **Tenant A (Basic Plan)**: $49/month + 50 enrollments √ó $1/enrollment ‚Üí **$99/month**  
- **Tenant B (Pro Plan)**: $199/month + 200 enrollments √ó $1/enrollment ‚Üí **$399/month**  
- **Tenant C (Enterprise)**: $500/month + 500 enrollments √ó 5% of course price ($20 avg) ‚Üí **$1,000+/month**
